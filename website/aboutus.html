    <p>
        I am a girl from a rural village in Limpopo, a place where opportunities seemed limited, and the future was uncertain. After finishing matric, I wasn’t sure about what direction I wanted my life to take. I felt lost, unsure of what I wanted to do, like many other young people figuring out their next step.
        <br><br>
        Then, I discovered coding at Rosebank College. At first, it seemed like just another subject, but as time went on, something changed. I started enjoying the challenges and the satisfaction that came with solving problems and creating something from nothing. Slowly but surely, I fell in love with coding and technology. What began as a curiosity turned into a passion, and that passion opened doors to new opportunities I never thought possible.
        <br><br>
        I realized that my journey wasn’t just about coding—it was about finding my place in a world I hadn’t imagined before. It was about proving to myself that no matter where I came from, I could create and contribute. Her Tech Journey is my way of sharing this story and encouraging other girls like me, especially those from rural areas, to embrace technology. It’s my way of showing that no dream is too big, no matter how far away it may seem.
        <br><br>
        Through Her Tech Journey, I aim to inspire others to step out of their comfort zones, to explore new possibilities, and to believe in their potential to make an impact in the world of tech. If I can do it, so can you.
